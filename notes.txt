each spaceship has a list of slots. each slot can be one of guns, lasers, missiles, drives, or shields.

20 system slots by default

gene: 20 slots, preferred range

shield multiplication factor of 3.

(GLMDSSMGLSDSMLGMLSDS, 16) transforms to:

SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSGLMDMGLDMLGMLD_16.

initial range of 20.

preferred range is an integer, 1-20 inclusive.

ships start at initial range, firing all their guns at each other and then moving.

every time a hit is scored, one system is removed from the front of the ship, like:

SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSGLMDMGLDMLGMLD
SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSGLMDMGLDMLGMLD
...
D

a ship can move one unit towards its preferred range for each drive it has.

to win, a ship must destroy all the systems on the other ship and have one drive left.

if neither ship has any remaining drives or neither ship has any weapons left, it's a draw.

if a draw or victory has not been reached after 100 turns, it's a draw.

fitness is determined by winning (gladiatorial tournament selection).

find two winners and two losers. the winners mate and overwrite the losers.
